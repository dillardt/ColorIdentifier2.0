# Instruction (in progress)
How to use. I use windows power toys color picker tool to get the rgb value of the screen. The tool outputs the color to the clipboard in the format "rgb(100, 10, 1)" (incase you wanted to copy rgb by hand). You can also find the color name of the average color of an image that is copied to the clipboard.

The csv file can be edited to add more of your own colors. (all current colors were grabbed from html examples)

# Where I want this project to go
1. I want to make the csv spreadsheat autofill in missing values, such as values for other color spaces.
2. I want to add my own color picker tool and not have to rely on the windows power toy.
3. Maybe have a tally for how many times each color has been tested.

In the far future I want to make a mobile app for this.
